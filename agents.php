          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. At the age of 12
            I asked if I could fly by myself to Hawaii and I never came back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right out of high school I started into travel school and have had
            the opportunity to work in many aspects of the industry. In every
            aspect I have worked I have had the opportunity to help people
            travel, to help fulfill people's dreams, what could be better to do
            every day!
